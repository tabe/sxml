An R6RS library for SXML


== License

The public domain


== Specification

Since neither `@' nor `@@' is valid as <identifier> in R6RS [0],
this program uses `^' and `^^' respectively, instead.
See [1] if interested.


== Acknowledgements

This program owes its whole to the original SXML/SSAX library ([2], [3]).


== Notes

* Tests needs Ypsilon [4] with an external library (xunit) [5];
  Run `YPSILON_SITELIB="path of (xunit)" make test'.
